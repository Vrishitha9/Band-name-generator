# Band Name Generator — Day 1

This is Day 1 of learning Python.

First-day practice — learning `print`, `input`, and basic logic.  
This project is a beginner-friendly exercise that builds simple program logic and helps students who are new to programming by creating small quizzes and interactive scripts.

## What it is
A tiny script that asks for a couple of inputs and uses them to generate a band name (or similar short interactive outputs). Intended as a learning exercise for absolute beginners.

## How to run
From the project directory, run:
```bash
python "Band name generator day 1.py"
```
(Or, if you rename the file to remove spaces:)
```bash
python band_name_generator_day1.py
```

## Example run
```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
Enter the city you grew up in: Tokyo
Enter your pet's name: Kiko
Your band name could be: Tokyo Kiko


## License
Add a license if you want others to reuse your code (MIT is a common choice for small learning projects).
